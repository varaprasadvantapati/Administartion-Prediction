 Admission Prediction System

 📌 Overview
This project implements an Admission (Administration) Prediction System using machine learning techniques.  
The objective is to predict the probability of admission of a student based on various academic and profile-related factors.

Such systems are useful for students to evaluate their chances of admission and for institutions to analyze applicant data.


 🧠 Dataset
The dataset typically includes features such as:
- GRE Score
- TOEFL Score
- University Rating
- Statement of Purpose (SOP)
- Letter of Recommendation (LOR)
- CGPA
- Research Experience

Target Variable:
- Chance of Admission (continuous value between 0 and 1)



 ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  



 🏗️ Model Details
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Train-test data splitting
- Machine Learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression *(or other models if used)*
- Model evaluation using accuracy / R² score / error metrics



 🚀 Features
- Loads and preprocesses admission dataset
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trains a prediction model
- Evaluates model performance
- Predicts admission chances for new inputs
- Visualizes relationships between features and admission probability



 📊 Results
- The model predicts admission probability with good accuracy
- Shows strong correlation between CGPA, GRE score, and admission chances
